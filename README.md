# Cougar-Casino
CIS 256 Project

Your first assignment is to review the skills you gained from Python Level I. What better way than with the creation of your very on Casino!

1. Your casino should allow the user to login or register if they are a new to the casino. (2 points)

2. Allow the user to check their balance. (1 point)

3. Allow the user to add or withdraw money to their balance. (You cannot over withdraw) (2 points)

4. Allow the user to choose a game to play (Roulette, Craps, Blackjack) (1 point)

5. For Roulette, a random pockets is selected from 0 to 36. A player can place a bet on a number, or a color, or even/odd. Based on the bet, the payout for winning are 35 to 1 for a number and 1 to 1 for correct color or even/odd. For example, if I bet $1 and win by betting on a number, I would get $35 plus my $1 I bet for a total of $36. If I bet $1 and win by betting on color or even/odd, I would get $1 plus my $1 I bet for a total of $2. The pockets of the roulette wheel are numbered from 0 to 36. In number ranges from 1 to 10 and 19 to 28, odd numbers are red and even are black. In ranges from 11 to 18 and 29 to 36, odd numbers are black and even are red. There is a green pocket numbered 0 (zero). The order is 0-32-15-19-4-21-2-25-17-34-6-27-13-36-11-30-8-23-10-5-24-16-33-1-20-14-31-9-22-18-29-7-28-12-35-3-26.  (6 points)

6. For Craps, a pair of 6-sided dice are rolled and the total is calculated. On the first roll, you win if a 7 or 11 roll, or lose if 2, 3, or 12 roll (known as “craps”). After that roll, any other number that rolls becomes the “point” and the point must roll again before a 7 to win. For example, I roll and get 5, then 2, 3, 4, and 5 again, so I win, or I roll and get 5, 2, 3, 4, 3 again, I win. If you win, the payout is 1 to 1. For example, if I bet $1 and win, I would get $1 plus my $1 I bet for a total of $2. ( 7 points)

7. For Blackjack, a standard deck of 52 cards is used by a dealer. There are 4 suits of Clubs, Spades, Diamonds, and Hearts and 13 values of Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King. The dealer will deal a card to the player face up, then to themselves face up. Dealer then deals another card to the player face up. At this point, the player can choose to be dealt addition cards at their leisure (known as a hit), or stop receiving cards (known as a stand), or surrender when their total is more than 21 (known as surrender or bust). After the player stands, the dealer then continues to deal to themselves until they total 17 or more. If the player has more than the dealer in value without busting, they win; otherwise, it is a lost. Number cards count as their number, the jack, queen, and king ("face cards" or "pictures") count as 10, and aces count as either 1 or 11 according to the player's choice. If the total exceeds 21 points, it busts, and all bets on it immediately lose. If you win, the payout is 1 to 1. For example, if I bet $1 and win, I would get $1 plus my $1 I bet for a total of $2. (9 points)

8. After checking the balance, depositing or withdrawing money, and each game, the player should have the option to exit completely. (1 point)

9. It should go without saying that the balance of the user should be saved as well when program ends for future login access. (1 point)

Sounds like fun right. Let's see how you do with this. Use all of the tools in your Python Programming belt. You are allowed to use object-oriented programming, but it is not necessary.
